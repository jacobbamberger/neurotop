This accompanies my semester project 'Stimulating artificial neurons with simplex and
torus networks: an information-theoretic study' combining tools from topology and 
information theory to study simulations of small neural networks. 


The order in which I suggest reading this is the following:
1) have a look at my write-up/presentation
2) have a look at the simulation.py, which is the main file for running simulations
3) look at the CommonParents notebook to see how the experiments/figures in Section 4.1 were generated
4) look at the ParentConnComparer notebook to see how the experiments/figures in Section 4.2 were generated

then hopefully you have the tools to generate your own experiments :)

This project was a continuation of Skander Moalla's Bachelor thesis, which can be found 
here: https://github.com/skandermoalla/it-simplex. To see a less complicated simulation than min, 
the notebook https://github.com/skandermoalla/it-simplex/blob/master/IT_Neuro_basics.ipynb could 
be usefull. This repo is for the next person to work on a similar project, hope it helps, feel free 
to contact me with any questions!# neurotop_project
